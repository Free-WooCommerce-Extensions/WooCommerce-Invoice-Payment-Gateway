By David Paulsson - http://davidpaulsson.se/

== DESCRIPTION ==
Provides an Invoice Payment Gateway, mainly for B2B segment where instant payment via PayPal etc. is not a viable option.

== IMPORTANT NOTE ==
This plugin does NOT create the invoices for you. It only completes the order and sends out the order confirmation emails. The actual invoices still needs to be created and sent to the customer.
